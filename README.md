## Project Summary: Cryptocurrency Clustering Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

<p> This project demonstrates the application of __unsupervised machine learning__ techniques to segment and analyze cryptocurrencies, focusing on Bitcoin, based on their behavior and correlation patterns. The objective is to explore the structure within the data using clustering algorithms to identify hidden patterns and natural groupings among cryptocurrencies.

___

##  Data Overview:
<p> The dataset used for this project is fictitious and contains various metrics such as price changes, market trends, and volatility for different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. The data was generated to simulate real-world behavior, allowing us to practice and showcase clustering techniques.

___

## Methodology:
<p> I used __StandardScaler__ to normalize the data, followed by __PCA__ to reduce dimensionality, capturing 88.44% of the variance. I then applied __K-Means clustering__, using the __Elbow method__ to determine the optimal number of clusters (k=4). The results were visualized with __scatter plots__, showing clear cluster separation.

___

## Findings: 
* The clustering results revealed distinct behavior patterns among cryptocurrencies, allowing us to segment them into groups with similar market behavior.
* The application of PCA helped in reducing complexity while retaining key information, making it easier to identify patterns in the data.

___

## Conclusion:
<p> This project demonstrates the successful use of unsupervised machine learning to segment cryptocurrencies based on their performance metrics. By using K-Means clustering and PCA, we were able to identify meaningful clusters that could potentially be used for further market analysis or investment strategies. The fictitious dataset used here illustrates my ability to implement these techniques effectively in real-world scenarios.
